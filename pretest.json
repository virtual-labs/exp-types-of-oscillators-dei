      "question": "1. Which of the following is a characteristic of free oscillations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They always require an external periodic force",
        "b": "They occur due to internal restoring forces like gravity or elasticity",
        "c": "Their amplitude always increases with time",
        "d": "They cannot occur in simple pendulums"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes forced oscillations.",
        "b": "Correct. Free oscillations are maintained only by internal restoring forces.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Amplitude remains constant in ideal free oscillations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Simple pendulums are classic examples of free oscillations."

    {
      "question": "2. In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the restoring force is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Directly proportional to displacement and opposite in direction",
        "b": "Proportional to velocity",
        "c": "Constant regardless of displacement",
        "d": "Independent of displacement"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. F = -kx is the fundamental law of SHM.",
        "b": "Incorrect. That describes damping.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Restoring force changes with displacement.",
        "d": "Incorrect. SHM depends directly on displacement."

      "question": "3. What happens to the amplitude of a damped oscillator over time?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It remains constant",
        "b": "It gradually decreases",
        "c": "It gradually increases",
        "d": "It fluctuates randomly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Constant amplitude occurs only in ideal free oscillations.",
        "b": "Correct. Damping reduces amplitude due to resistive forces.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Energy is lost, not gained.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The decrease is systematic, not random."

      "question": "4. Which of the following is an example of a forced oscillator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A tuning fork vibrating in air",
        "b": "A car suspension system",
        "c": "A pendulum pushed periodically by hand",
        "d": "A simple pendulum oscillating freely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Thatâ€™s an example of free oscillations.",
        "b": "Partially correct. Suspensions involve damping mainly.",
        "c": "Correct. The pendulum matches the frequency of the applied periodic force.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That is a free oscillator."

      "question": "5. At resonance in a lightly damped forced oscillator:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Amplitude becomes maximum",
        "b": "Amplitude becomes zero",
        "c": "Amplitude remains constant at all frequencies",
        "d": "Oscillations stop completely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Resonance occurs when driving frequency equals natural frequency, giving maximum amplitude.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Amplitude does not vanish.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Amplitude depends on driving frequency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Oscillations only stop with infinite damping."
