      "question": "1. To study simple harmonic motion in the simulation, the value of the damping factor b is set to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "b > 2√2",
        "b": "b = 2√2",
        "c": "b = 0",
        "d": "b = 0.5"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. b > 2√2 produces over-damped oscillations.",
        "b": "Incorrect. b = 2√2 produces critically damped motion.",
        "c": "Correct. Setting b = 0 removes all damping, giving pure simple harmonic motion.",
        "d": "Incorrect. b = 0.5 gives under-damped oscillations, not pure SHM."

      "answers": {
        "a": "b = 0",

        "d": "b > 2√2"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. b = 0 means no damping — this is pure SHM.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This condition gives critical damping.",
        "c": "Correct. When b < 2√2, the system oscillates with exponentially decreasing amplitude (under-damped).",
        "d": "Incorrect. This condition gives over-damped (non-oscillatory) motion."

        "c": "ω = √(k/m − b²/4m²)",
        "d": "ω = b/2m"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 1/T gives ordinary frequency f, not angular frequency.",
        "b": "Correct. Angular frequency ω = 2πf, where f is the oscillation frequency read from the simulation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This formula applies to the damped oscillator, not the free oscillator case.",
        "d": "Incorrect. b/2m is the decay constant γ."

        "d": "Critically Damped Oscillation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Free oscillation means no external driving force and no damping — pure SHM.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Damped oscillation loses energy; it is not a free oscillation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Forced oscillation requires an external periodic force.",

        "d": "A = m · ω²"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. F₀·ω is not dimensionally consistent for amplitude.",
        "b": "Incorrect. F₀/k gives static deflection, not the dynamic amplitude.",
        "c": "Correct. This is the standard formula for steady-state amplitude of a driven damped oscillator.",
        "d": "Incorrect. m·ω² has units of force divided by length, not amplitude."

      "question": "6. During the forced oscillation experiment, the driven angular frequency ω is set to 1.41 rad/sec. This is because:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1.41 is a standard default value with no special significance",
        "b": "It approximates √2, close to the natural frequency ω₀ = √(k/m) = √2 for k = 2, m = 1",
        "c": "It is above the critical damping threshold",
        "d": "It ensures the system is always over-damped"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The value is deliberately chosen to be near resonance.",
        "b": "Correct. √2 ≈ 1.414 rad/sec matches ω₀ = √(k/m) for k = 2 N/m and m = 1 kg, inducing near-resonance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The critical damping threshold concerns the damping factor b, not ω.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Over-damping is controlled by b, not by the value of ω."

      "question": "7. When the damping factor b is set to 3 in the simulation, the expected motion of the system is:",

        "a": "Oscillatory with slowly decreasing amplitude",
        "b": "Oscillatory with constant amplitude",
        "c": "Non-oscillatory; the system slowly returns to equilibrium",
        "d": "Resonant oscillation with maximum amplitude"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes under-damped oscillation (b < 2√2 ≈ 2.83).",
        "b": "Incorrect. Constant amplitude occurs only without damping.",
        "c": "Correct. b = 3 > 2√2 ≈ 2.83 means over-damped; the displacement decays exponentially without oscillating.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Resonance requires the driving frequency to match ω₀."

      "question": "8. In the experiment for the under-damped case (Case 2), the computed spring constant k uses the measured ω and the relation:",

        "d": "k = ω / m"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This applies only to the undamped case where ω = ω₀ = √(k/m).",
        "b": "Correct. Rearranging ω = √(k/m − b²/4m²) gives k = m(ω² + b²/4m²).",
        "c": "Incorrect. k = b·ω is dimensionally and physically incorrect.",
        "d": "Incorrect. ω/m does not give the spring constant."

        "b": "The spring constant k",
        "c": "The amplitude A of oscillation",
        "d": "The time period T"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. ω₀ = √(k/m) depends only on k and m, not on initial displacement.",
        "b": "Incorrect. k is a property of the spring and does not change with x₀.",
        "c": "Correct. In SHM, the initial displacement x₀ sets the amplitude A of oscillation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. T = 2π/ω₀ is independent of amplitude in SHM."

      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "10. In the forced oscillation experiment (Case 3), what happens to the amplitude A as F₀ is increased (with ω and ω₀ fixed)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A decreases proportionally",
        "b": "A remains unchanged",
        "c": "A increases proportionally to F₀",
        "d": "A becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing the driving force increases the steady-state amplitude.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Amplitude depends directly on F₀.",
        "c": "Correct. From A = F₀/(m√[(ω²−ω₀²)²+4γ²m²]), A ∝ F₀ when all other parameters are fixed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Amplitude can only approach zero if F₀ → 0."
