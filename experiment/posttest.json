    {
      "question": "Which of the following is true for a simple harmonic oscillator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The restoring force is directly proportional to displacement and opposite in direction",
        "b": "The restoring force is proportional to velocity",
        "c": "The motion is non-periodic",
        "d": "The motion cannot be represented by a sine or cosine function"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In SHM, restoring force F = -kx, proportional to displacement and opposite in direction.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This describes damping, not SHM.",
        "c": "Incorrect. SHM is periodic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. SHM is represented by sine or cosine equations."

    {
      "question": "In a damped oscillator, the amplitude of oscillation:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Remains constant",
        "b": "Gradually decreases with time",
        "c": "Gradually increases with time",
        "d": "First increases then decreases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Constant amplitude occurs only in undamped SHM.",
        "b": "Correct. Damping causes energy loss and amplitude reduction over time.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Amplitude does not increase without external energy.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is not typical for a purely damped oscillator."

    {
      "question": "Which statement about a forced oscillator is correct?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It oscillates only at its natural frequency",
        "b": "It oscillates at the frequency of the applied force",
        "c": "It never reaches a steady-state amplitude",
        "d": "It cannot resonate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Forced oscillators match the frequency of the applied force, not just the natural frequency.",
        "b": "Correct. The oscillation frequency equals that of the external driving force.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Steady state can occur after transient effects die out.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Forced oscillators can resonate when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the energy in a damped harmonic oscillator over time?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It stays constant",
        "b": "It increases continuously",
        "c": "It decreases due to non-conservative forces",
        "d": "It fluctuates randomly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Energy is lost in damping.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Energy increases only if an external source adds power.",
        "c": "Correct. Non-conservative forces like friction convert mechanical energy into heat or sound.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The energy decrease is systematic, not random."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"

    {
      "question": "At resonance in a forced oscillator with light damping:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Amplitude is maximum",
        "b": "Amplitude is minimum",
        "c": "Amplitude remains constant regardless of frequency",
        "d": "Oscillation stops completely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Resonance causes the largest amplitude when driving frequency equals natural frequency.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This occurs when the driving frequency is far from the natural frequency.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Amplitude depends strongly on frequency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Oscillation continues unless damping is infinite."
