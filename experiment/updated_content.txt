PROCEDURE
The Procedure for the experiment is as follows:
	To study the simple harmonic motion
	Step 1: Set the damping factor (b) = 0.
	Step 2: Set v_0 = 0 m/s.
	Step 3: Drag the ball to the maximum starting position say, x_0 = 10.0 m and click the animation button.
	Step 4: Observe the position graph as shown in Fig. 1 and wait until the animation ends.
	Step 5: To get the position and velocity graph like Fig. 2, tick the velocity checkbox.

	To study damped oscillatory motion
	Step 1: Reset the simulation.
	Step 2: Set v_0  = 0 m/sec.
	Step 3: Change the damping factor (b) (say b = 0.5 or 2.8 or 3).
	Step 4: Drag the ball to the maximum initial position, say x_0 = 10.0 m and click the play button.
	Step 5: Perform the experiment for three different values of the damping factor (say b = 0.5, 2.8 and 3), resetting the simulation for each case.
	Step 6: Repeat the entire procedure as done previously.
Note: After selecting any damping checkbox (under-damped, over-damped and critically-damped), there is no need to manually set the value of b, as shown below.
Case 1: Under-Damping
Set the value of b < 2√2 (say b = 0.5)

part (J) image add from images/after adding (Fig. . Graph representing over-damped oscillatory motion (position vs time).)

 In all the above the cases, observe the graph and wait till until animation ends.
	To study forced oscillatory motion
	Step 1: Reset the simulation again.
	Step 2: Set the damping coefficient (b) > 2√2.
	Step 3: Change the value of initial velocity v_0 = 2 m/sec
	Step 4: Set value of driven angular frequency (ω) = 1.41
	Step 5: Set some values of driven amplitude F_0 which will be the force for oscillation.	
	Step 6: Drag the ball to the maximum starting position, say x_0 = 10.0 m and play the animation button.
	Step 7: Observe the graph till the animation ends
