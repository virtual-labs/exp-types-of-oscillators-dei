THEORY
Simple harmonic oscillators exhibit periodic motion with constant amplitude, while damped and forced types introduce energy loss or external driving forces. 
	Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a type of oscillating motion. A pendulum or an object hanging from spring will oscillate harmonically when there is a small deviation from its equilibrium or rest state. A restoring force proportionate to x is created when slight displacement x occurs from the equilibrium position. This force always acts in the opposite direction of the displacement, towards the equilibrium position.
F= -kx											(1)
where k is the spring constant (force constant).
This motion is used to model many physical systems in the real world where a mass oscillates about an equilibrium position.
	Simple Pendulum
A simple pendulum consists of a point mass (bob) suspended from a fixed support by a light, inextensible string of length L, free to oscillate in a vertical plane.
	Mass attached to a Spring
A mass attached to a spring fixed to a rigid wall executes SHM when displaced from equilibrium.
	Oscillations of a liquid column in a U-Tube
The motion of an oscillating liquid column in a U-tube is SHM with time period 
T=2π√(h/g)					(2)
where h is the height of the liquid column in one arm at equilibrium position of the liquid and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
Therefore, the time period T is independent of the density of the liquid.
	LC Oscillator
Another example is that of an LC electrical circuit, an inductance L connected across a capacitance C carrying charge q performs electrical oscillations analogous to SHM.
The general equation governing for simple harmonic motion is:
       mx ̈+bx ̇+kx=F_0  sin⁡(ωt+ϕ) 	              			 (3)
m: Mass of the ball in kg
F_0: Force in Newton (N)
b: Damping factor in Ns/m
k: Spring constant in N/m
ω: Angular frequency in rad/sec
t: Time period in sec
ϕ: Phase angle
	Free Oscillators
	Free oscillations, such as the swinging motion of a pendulum or the vibration of an elastic rod, occur when the motion is sustained by gravitational or elastic restoring forces. Undamped free vibration is the simplest form of vibrating motion. 
	Example: Simple pendulum oscillations, short-range tuning fork sound, sounds of musical instruments, ex. organ pipes, etc. are a few instances of free oscillations.

	Nature of Free Oscillators
	In free oscillations, the amplitude and frequency of a freely vibrating body remain constant. During this motion, the system neither gains nor losses energy. 
	In this type of motion, both the damping factor (b) and the forcing frequency (F_0) are equal to zero. 
Thus, equation (3) becomes:
                                    mx ̈+kx=0                                 			(4)
where, the solution of the equation is:
 Acos(ωt+φ) 					(5)
which represents simple harmonic motion, ω_0 is the natural angular frequency of the system√(k/m) .
	Damped Oscillators
When a moving particle interacts with resistive forces like air or friction, it gradually loses kinetic energy in damped oscillations. A particle's displacement gradually decreases over time and eventually reaches its state of rest as a result of the resistance provided by external forces.
Example:
Shock Absorbers
If the damping force F_0 is proportional to the velocity v_0 with a damping constant b, then
F_0 = -bv_0		 					 (6)
The equation of motion (3) becomes:
                              		  mx ̈+bx ̇+kx=0					(7)
The solution of the equation (5) is: 
              		                 Ae^(-γt) Cos(ωt+φ)               	          			(8)
Where, γ=b/2m and,
b: Damping factor in Ns/m
m: Mass of the ball in kg
and amplitude is given by: - 
                             		    A=F_0/(m√((ω^2-ω_0^2 )  +4γ^2 m^2 ))                                            (9)
ω_0 is natural angular frequency of the damped system and ω is the angular frequency of the damped oscillator.
                                           ω=√(k/m-b^2/(4m^2 ))                           			        (10)                                       
 b^2=4km
Damping is of three types:
	Under Damping
When damping is small, the system vibrates at first approximately as if there were no damping but the amplitude of the oscillations decreases exponentially.
Example: A swinging pendulum decreasing in amplitude until it comes to a stop.
Under damped oscillations: b < 2√2	
                                   x (t)=Ae^(-γt) Cos⁡(ωt+ϕ)                    		          (11)
Where,  γ=b/2m
b : Damping	factor,
m : Mass of the ball in kg.
And amplitude is given by: -
                              		     A=F_0/(m√((ω^2-ω_0^2 )  +4γ^2 m^2 ))	                                (12)
	Critical Damping
When a critically damped oscillator is displaced from the equilibrium, it will returns to rest at to its equilibrium position in the shortest possible time without oscillating. Critical damping occurs when the position of the mass asymptotically approaches zero. Depending on the initial velocity, the system either moves it monotonically towards zero or reaches a maximum displacement before reversing direction and returning to equilibrium .
Example: Car suspension systems prevent the car from oscillating after travelling over a bump in the road.
Critically damped oscillations:  b=2√2  or (≈2.8)
	Over Damping
When a heavily damped oscillator is displaced from the equilibrium, it takes a long time to return to its equilibrium position without oscillating. When damping is large, the system does not oscillate at all.
Example: Car suspension systems prevent the car from oscillating after travelling over a bump in the road.
Over damped oscillations: b > 2.8
x(t)=Ae^(-γt) Cos⁡(ωt+ϕ)	                       (13)
where, γ=b/2m
	Forced Oscillators
	Forced oscillations occur when an oscillating system is driven by a periodic external force.
Example:  Applying a periodic force on to a swinging pendulum or turning off a radio.
The related equation is:
mx ̈+bx ̇+kx=F_0  sin⁡(ωt+ϕ)             	(14)
where 
ω  :	Angular frequency for forced oscillations.
F_0 : 	Force for the forced oscillator
	Resonance
If the forcing frequency is close to the natural frequency of the system and the system is lightly damped, huge vibration amplitudes may occur. This phenomenon is known as resonance. Some of the examples are:
	Musical instruments (acoustic resonance).
	Most clocks keep time by mechanical resonance in a balance wheel, pendulum, or quartz crystal.
	Tidal resonance.
	Orbital resonance of some moons in the solar system.
	Resonance of the basilar membrane in the ear.
	Increasing the height of a child's swing higher by pushing it at each swing.
	A wineglass breaking when a loud sound is produced at its resonant frequency.
Additional Information
	Some of the other types of oscillators are:
Coupled Oscillators
Coupled oscillations occur when two or more oscillating systems are connected in such a way that energy can be exchanged between them. Coupled oscillators occur in nature, for example, in the Earth-Moon system, and in biological systems such as natural pacemakers in the heart.
